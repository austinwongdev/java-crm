# Java CRM

## Description
This Java application serves as a customer relationship management (CRM) system. It allows users to add, update, and remove customer data; manage appointments in a calendar; and run reports on appointment data.

This application was developed to fulfill the requirements for an Advanced Java Concepts academic project at WGU. It demonstrates database and file server application development skills. The application incorporates lambda expressions; advanced exception control mechanisms to improve user experience and application stability; localization and date/time APIs to support end-users in various geographical regions; and streams and filters to manipulate data more efficiently.
